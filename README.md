## Hi, I'm Hayden 👋

Hello! I'm a cybersecurity professional in-training. I completed my BA in Music from Santa Clara University in 2025, after graduating in only 3 years. About 2 years into college I had my idenity stolen, and my I fell down the rabbit-hole of cybersecurity while navigating that event. Since then, I have developed a passion for digital defense, automation, threat detection, vulnerability and penetration testing, and ethical hacking. I am currently completing a professional certificate in cybersecurity from Purdue University/Simplilearn (graduation Feb. 2026), and am concurrently preparing for the CompTIA Security+, and taking various classes on Coursera.
